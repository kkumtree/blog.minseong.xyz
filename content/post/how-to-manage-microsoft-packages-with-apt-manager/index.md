Microsoft gave us a lot of programs as Ubuntu/Debian packages.  

In this post, I will show you how to manage Edge and VSCode packages with APT package manager.  

## Why?  

Simple. I want to upgrade them easily with APT package manager rather than using `dpkg` command.  

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y  
```

When I installed Microsoft Edge and Visual Studio Code, I used `dpkg` command.
But, It is little burdensome to manage packages with `dpkg` command in Update/Upgrade.

So, I want to manage them with APT package manager instead of `dpkg` command.

Beyond of the ~basic~ security vulnerability of applications,  
I have to upgrade them to use useful features.  

Such as GitHub Copilot Chat in VSCode, a.k.a. my long time friend for coding. LoL.  

## Structure  

As I'm just one of Ubuntu users, I'm little bit understood about how APT package manager works.  

And, I summarized them as below.

### (0) Add Microsoft GPG Key

First, you need to add Microsoft GPG Key to your system.

> There are neither `CORRECT ANSWER` nor `INCORRECT ANSWER` for this.  
> All is up to you.  

```bash
# Option 1
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg
```

```bash
# Option 2

curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg
```

### (1) Add Microsoft Repository to get Package metadata

At first, you need to add Microsoft Repository to your system.  
So, APT package manager can find Microsoft packages.  

```bash
# Microsoft Edge
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-edge.list

# Visual Studio Code
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
```

> There are also neither `CORRECT ANSWER` nor `INCORRECT ANSWER` for this.
> Alternative naming for `microsft-edge.list` and `vscode.list` are up to you.

- e.g.) Below also works for Visual Studio Code.  

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
```

### (2) Decryption metadata with Microsoft GPG Key

APT package manager already hits Microsoft Repository to get metadata.  

e.g.) `https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/<package-name> stable InRelease`

So, APT package manager decrypts metadata with Microsoft GPG Key.  

If you don't have Microsoft GPG Key, you will get errors.  

### (3) Install Microsoft DEB packages  

Finally, APT package manager installs Microsoft DEB packages on your behalf!  

## Descriptions

### Microsoft's GPG public key

You could verify the Microsoft GPG public key.  
See, [How to use the GPG Repository Signing Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linux/packages#how-to-use-the-gpg-repository-signing-key)  

### How Microsoft signs the packages with GPG public key  

You have Microsoft GPG public key to verify the packages in installation.  

> (...) in deb-based distributions it is common to sign the repository metadata but not the individual debs. Microsoft signs both the individual packages and the repository metadata for both types of distributions. (...)

See, [Signature Verification](https://github.com/microsoft/linux-package-repositories?tab=readme-ov-file#signature-verification)  

### How looks like InRelease file

### My Screenshots  

- When I upgrade my system from 22.04 LTS Jammy to 23.10 Mantic, APT sources are disabled.

- My GPG public keyrings for update/upgrade

- My sources.list.d and APT package manager hits Microsoft Repositories properly.  

> I'll remove `vscode.list.distUpgrade` and `vscode.sources` files.
